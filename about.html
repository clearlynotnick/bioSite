            <p>My name is Leslie Blume and I was born and raised in Indiana in a small town a few hours outside of Louisville. Ever since I was young, I always loved being
a part of the musical world! I was introduced to music by my grandmother who still is the current organ player for our local Catholic church. We learned music
through hyms and other songs and it was where I really began to realize this is what I wanted to pursue whenever I got older. Throughout high school I had a 
few different passions including basketball, marching band, and being a vocalist with the church and was eventually able to be accepted to Murray State University for music.</p>

<p>Murray State was where I really began to transform myself musically. I was able to participate in a multitude of groups including a Horn Choir, the Concert Choir, our universities Marching Band, and also explore different Music Business opportunities! I performed with the Opera Workshop, had my own Senior Recital including performing for others, and I was able to experience so many different avenues and learn all the different career possibilities of music as well. Originally I wasn't planning on becoming a teacher but, as my went farther along into my musical career, I found a passion that I didn't have before for the profession. </p>

<p>As time has passed, I have changed a lot myself not only as a musician but also as a teacher. Growing up it was about focusing on myself as a teacher and now that I have my own students, I strive to become a better teacher and give them all the options that I can offer! I want to be able to inspire them to love music the same way that I have and learn how to push them to become better every single day. As a vocalist and an instrumentalist, I have been blessed to have so many different opportunities to perform and transform myself musically and I want to be able to give all my students those same opportunities. I've only been teaching for a few years but I have so many different plans for myself and my students that I'm so excited to do!
